    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption is a central issue for modern economies, as it reflects both economic activity and household behavior, while also posing major challenges for energy planning and climate policy. Understanding the factors that drive electricity demand is therefore crucial for anticipating peaks in consumption, ensuring grid stability, and supporting the energy transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the determinants of electricity consumption, weather conditions — and temperature in particular — play a key role. In countries where heating and cooling systems rely partly on electricity, cold spells and heat waves can generate large and sudden variations in demand. These effects are often highly seasonal and may differ across regions depending on climate, population density, and economic structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigates the relationship between **daily temperature and electricity consumption across French regions** over the period **2020–2024**. France provides an interesting case study due to its diverse regional climates, its relatively high share of electric heating, and the availability of detailed open data on both electricity consumption and weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main research question of this study is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **To what extent does daily temperature influence electricity consumption across regions in France?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we combine regional electricity consumption data with meteorological data obtained from the NASA POWER API. We conduct a descriptive analysis to characterize seasonal patterns and regional heterogeneity, and we complement it with simple regression models to quantify the statistical relationship between temperature variations and electricity demand. Throughout the analysis, particular attention is paid to distinguishing differences in consumption levels across regions from the sensitivity of consumption to temperature changes within regions.\n"

    "## 2. Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "This study relies on two main sources of open data: regional electricity consumption data for France and meteorological data obtained via an external API. Both datasets are available at a daily frequency and cover the period from **2020 to 2024**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Electricity Consumption Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption data are obtained from the French electricity transmission system operator (RTE) through its open data platform. The dataset provides **daily electricity consumption aggregated at the regional level** for metropolitan France.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data include electricity demand measured in megawatt-hours (MWh) for each region and each day. These data offer a detailed view of spatial and temporal variations in electricity use across France, making them particularly suitable for analyzing regional heterogeneity in consumption patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Weather Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather data are retrieved from the **NASA POWER (Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources) API**, which provides standardized meteorological variables derived from satellite observations and reanalysis products. The API allows automated and reproducible access to historical weather data at specific geographic locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each French region, representative geographic coordinates are selected to extract daily weather conditions. The main variable of interest is the **daily mean temperature at 2 meters (T2M)**, expressed in degrees Celsius. Additional meteorological variables are also available in the raw data but are not central to the core analysis presented in this report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Temporal and Spatial Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "Both datasets cover the same time span, from **January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2024**, and are aligned at a **daily frequency**. Weather observations are matched to electricity consumption data by **region and date**, resulting in a balanced panel dataset with daily observations for each metropolitan region.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedures for data retrieval, aggregation, and cleaning are implemented in dedicated notebooks to ensure full reproducibility. The present report focuses on the analysis and interpretation of the resulting merged dataset.\n"

    "## 3. Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to analysis, the electricity consumption and weather datasets are processed and combined to obtain a clean and consistent dataset suitable for regional and temporal analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption data are first aggregated at the **daily regional level**, ensuring consistency across regions and over time. Weather data retrieved from the NASA POWER API are already available at a daily frequency and are organized by region and date based on the selected geographic coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two datasets are then merged using **region identifiers and dates** as common keys. This merging process results in a balanced panel dataset containing daily observations for each metropolitan region over the period 2020–2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic data cleaning steps are applied to ensure data quality. In particular, dates are converted to a standard datetime format, variable names are harmonized, and observations with missing values in the key variables (electricity consumption and daily mean temperature) are checked. The final dataset does not exhibit systematic missing values for these variables, allowing the analysis to proceed without imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting dataset consists of **daily observations for 12 French regions**, with each observation including electricity consumption (in MWh) and daily mean temperature (in °C). This clean and structured dataset serves as the basis for the descriptive and econometric analyses presented in the following sections.\n"

    "## 4. Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "This section presents descriptive statistics for electricity consumption and temperature across French regions over the period 2020–2024. The objective is to characterize the main features of the data, highlight regional heterogeneity, and identify broad temporal patterns prior to formal modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Summary Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 1 reports summary statistics for daily electricity consumption and daily mean temperature, computed over all regions and dates. Electricity consumption exhibits substantial variability, with large differences between minimum and maximum values, reflecting both seasonal fluctuations and regional differences in demand. Temperature also displays a wide range, from very cold winter days to hot summer periods, suggesting that weather conditions may play an important role in shaping electricity demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the regional level, average electricity consumption varies considerably across regions. Île-de-France stands out with the highest average consumption, while smaller or less densely populated regions exhibit lower demand. In contrast, regional differences in average temperature are more moderate. This contrast suggests that factors other than climate, such as population density and economic activity, contribute to differences in baseline electricity consumption across regions.\n"
