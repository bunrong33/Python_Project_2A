    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption is a central issue for modern economies, as it reflects household behavior and economic activity while posing major challenges for energy planning and grid stability. In a context of climate change and increasing weather variability, understanding the determinants of electricity demand is particularly important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these determinants, temperature plays a key role. In countries where heating relies partly on electricity, colder temperatures are typically associated with higher electricity demand, while warmer periods correspond to lower consumption. These effects are often seasonal and may differ across regions depending on climate, population density, and economic structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigates the relationship between **daily temperature and electricity consumption across French regions** over the period **2020–2024**. France provides a relevant case study due to its diverse regional climates, its relatively high share of electric heating, and the availability of detailed open data on both electricity consumption and weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main research question is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **To what extent does daily temperature influence electricity consumption across regions in France?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this question, the analysis proceeds in three steps. First, descriptive statistics are used to document regional and seasonal patterns. Second, the relationship between temperature and electricity consumption is explored using correlations and time-series visualizations. These results motivate a more formal econometric analysis presented later in the report."

    "## 2. Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "This study relies on two main sources of open data, both available at a daily frequency and covering the period from **January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2024**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Electricity Consumption Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption data are obtained from the French electricity transmission system operator (RTE). The dataset provides **daily electricity consumption aggregated at the regional level** for metropolitan France, measured in megawatt-hours (MWh).\n",
    "\n",
    "These data allow for the analysis of temporal dynamics and regional heterogeneity in electricity demand across France.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weather Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather data are retrieved from the **NASA POWER API**, which provides standardized meteorological variables derived from satellite observations and reanalysis products. The main variable used in this study is the **daily mean temperature at 2 meters (T2M)**, expressed in degrees Celsius.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API allows reproducible access to historical weather data at specific geographic coordinates, making it possible to construct consistent regional temperature indicators."

    "## 3. Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption and weather data originate from different sources and therefore require preprocessing before joint analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption data obtained from RTE are aggregated at the **daily regional level**. This aggregation aligns the data with the daily frequency of weather observations and smooths short-term intra-day fluctuations, allowing the analysis to focus on demand variations that are plausibly related to temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather data are constructed using **multiple representative geographic points within each region**. For each region, daily mean temperature (T2M) is computed as the average across these points, capturing regional climatic conditions while reducing sensitivity to any single location.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center> <img src=\"../figure/weather_map.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/> </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 1** shows that weather observations are spatially distributed within each region rather than concentrated at a single location. This spatial coverage supports the construction of regional temperature series that are representative of overall regional climatic conditions and less sensitive to local extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "After harmonizing date formats and regional identifiers, electricity consumption and weather data are merged using **region and date** as common keys. Basic validation checks confirm the consistency of the merged dataset and the absence of systematic missing values.\n"

    "## 4. Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "This section presents descriptive statistics for electricity consumption and temperature in order to characterize regional heterogeneity, variability, and seasonal patterns prior to formal modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regional Differences in Electricity Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "Average daily electricity consumption differs substantially across French regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center> <img src=\"../figure/avg_ele_consumption_region.png\" alt=\"Average electricity consumption by region\" style=\"width: 650px;\"/> </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We see strong regional heterogeneity in baseline electricity demand. Île-de-France stands out as a clear outlier with the highest average consumption, while several other regions exhibit much lower average demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distribution and Variability of Electricity Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond differences in average levels, electricity consumption also varies markedly within regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/consummation_distribution.png\" alt=\"Electricity consumption distribution\" style=\"width: 650px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We see a wide distribution of daily electricity consumption values, indicating substantial variability over time. This suggests that average consumption alone does not fully summarize regional demand patterns and that daily fluctuations are an important feature of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seasonal Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption and temperature exhibit clear and opposite seasonal patterns over the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/seasonal_pattern.png\" alt=\"National electricity consumption and temperature over time\" style=\"width: 650px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that electricity consumption peaks during colder periods and declines during warmer months, while temperature follows the opposite cycle. This inverse seasonal co-movement is consistent with increased heating-related electricity demand during winter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Year-by-Year Regional Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the stability of regional patterns over time, yearly averages of electricity consumption and temperature are computed for each region.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/yearly_temperature_by_region.png\" alt=\"Average yearly temperature by region\" style=\"width: 650px;\"/>\n",

    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/yearly_consumption_by_region.png\" alt=\"Average yearly electricity consumption by region\" style=\"width: 650px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe that both temperature and electricity consumption patterns are stable across regions over time. While southern regions consistently exhibit higher average temperatures and northern regions remain colder, Île-de-France does not rank among the coldest regions. Despite this, it consistently displays the highest electricity consumption across all years. This contrast indicates that high electricity demand in Île-de-France is largely driven by structural factors rather than climatic conditions, while temperature mainly explains short-run fluctuations within regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Winter–Summer Contrast in Electricity Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "To further quantify seasonal differences in electricity demand, average electricity consumption is computed separately for winter and summer for each region. The winter-to-summer ratio provides a normalized measure of seasonal intensity that allows meaningful comparison across regions with different consumption levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center> <img src=\"../figure/summer_winter_table.png\" alt=\"Winter and summer electricity consumption by region\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/> </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Winter electricity consumption exceeds summer consumption in all regions, confirming the presence of a strong and systematic seasonal effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude of this seasonal gap varies substantially across regions. Winter-to-summer consumption ratios range from about 1.3 in southern regions such as PACA to more than 1.6 in Île-de-France, highlighting significant heterogeneity in seasonal sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, Île-de-France exhibits one of the largest winter–summer differences despite not being among the coldest regions. This indicates that temperature primarily explains short-run seasonal fluctuations within regions, while persistent differences in electricity demand levels are largely driven by structural factors rather than climatic conditions alone."

    "## 5. Relationship Between Temperature and Electricity Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "This section examines the relationship between daily temperature and electricity consumption prior to the regression analysis. The objective is to assess whether temperature is systematically associated with electricity demand and to characterize the nature of this relationship using correlations and visual inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide a first quantitative summary, the correlation between daily mean temperature (T2M) and electricity consumption is computed separately for each region.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/correlation.png\" alt=\"Electricity consumption vs temperature\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe a **strong negative correlation** between temperature and electricity consumption in all regions. This indicates that electricity demand tends to increase on colder days and decrease as temperatures rise. The magnitude of the correlation varies across regions, reflecting differences in climate conditions, heating needs, and baseline consumption levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "While correlations confirm the existence of a systematic relationship, they do not distinguish between **within-region variation over time** and **cross-region differences in consumption levels**. This motivates a closer visual inspection and, subsequently, a regression-based approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperature–Consumption Scatter Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The scatter plot below illustrates the relationship between daily temperature and electricity consumption across all observations.\n",

    "<img src=\"../figure/ele_vs_consommation.png\" alt=\"Electricity consumption vs temperature\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe a clear negative association between temperature and electricity consumption, with higher demand concentrated at lower temperatures. This pattern is consistent with increased heating demand during colder periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, the wide dispersion of observations for a given temperature level highlights substantial heterogeneity in electricity consumption that cannot be explained by temperature alone. This dispersion reflects persistent regional differences in baseline demand, as well as other unobserved factors influencing electricity consumption.\n"

    "## 6. Regression Analysis: Temperature and Electricity Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "This section quantifies the relationship between daily temperature and electricity consumption using linear regression models. The objective is to measure how electricity demand responds to temperature variations while accounting for persistent regional differences in consumption levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "All models are estimated using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). Heteroskedasticity-robust (HC1) standard errors are reported to account for potential heteroskedasticity in daily electricity consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pooled OLS Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "We first estimate a pooled OLS regression that relates electricity consumption to daily mean temperature across all regions and dates:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Consommation}_{it} = \\alpha + \\beta \\,\\text{T2M}_{it} + \\varepsilon_{it}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\text{Consommation}_{it}$ denotes daily electricity consumption in region $i$ on day $t$,\n",
    "$\\text{T2M}_{it}$ is the daily mean temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "This specification captures the average association between temperature and electricity consumption, ignoring regional heterogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/pool_OLS.png\" alt=\"Average electricity consumption by region\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimated temperature coefficient is negative and statistically significant. A one-degree Celsius increase in daily mean temperature is associated with a reduction of approximately 5,160 MWh in electricity consumption. This result is consistent with higher electricity demand during colder days due to heating needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the model explains only a limited share of the overall variation in electricity consumption, with $R^2$ of about 0.13. This indicates that temperature alone cannot account for large differences in consumption across regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Region Fixed Effects Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To control for persistent regional differences, we estimate a model including region fixed effects:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Consommation}_{it} = \\alpha + \\beta\\,\\text{T2M}_{it} + \\gamma_i + \\varepsilon_{it}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\gamma_i$ captures time-invariant regional characteristics such as population size, economic activity, and housing stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/fixed_OLS.png\" alt=\"Average electricity consumption by region\" style=\"width: 650px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once regional fixed effects are included, the estimated temperature coefficient remains negative, statistically significant, and similar in magnitude (approximately −5,070 MWh per °C). This suggests that the temperature–consumption relationship reflects within-region variation over time rather than cross-region differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The explanatory power of the model increases substantially, with an $R^2$ of about 0.90, indicating that regional heterogeneity accounts for most of the variation in electricity consumption. Temperature mainly explains short-run fluctuations within regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimated fixed effects confirm that Île-de-France has systematically higher electricity consumption than other regions, even after controlling for temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison of Model Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/compare.png\" alt=\"Average electricity consumption by region\" style=\"width: 450px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the two specifications shows that the estimated temperature effect is stable across models, while controlling for regional fixed effects dramatically improves model fit. This highlights the dominant role of structural regional factors in determining consumption levels, with temperature acting as a key driver of short-term variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results should be interpreted as statistical associations rather than causal effects. Nevertheless, they are consistent with the descriptive analysis and provide strong evidence that temperature plays an important role in shaping daily electricity consumption patterns in France.\n"

    "## 7. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "This section discusses the main findings of the analysis by synthesizing the descriptive evidence and regression results. The objective is to clarify what temperature explains in electricity consumption patterns, and what remains driven by structural regional factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Île-de-France Case\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all stages of the analysis, Île-de-France stands out as a distinct case. Descriptive statistics show that it consistently exhibits the highest average electricity consumption, despite not being among the coldest regions. This pattern persists when examining seasonal contrasts and yearly averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regression results confirm this observation. Even after controlling for temperature through a region fixed effects model, Île-de-France displays a positive and significant fixed effect. This indicates that its high electricity demand is not primarily driven by climatic conditions, but rather by structural characteristics such as population density, economic activity, and urban infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regional Heterogeneity in Electricity Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis reveals substantial and persistent regional heterogeneity in electricity consumption levels. While temperature explains a large share of short-run variation within regions, it does not account for the large differences in baseline consumption observed across regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sharp increase in explanatory power when including region fixed effects highlights the importance of time-invariant regional characteristics. These structural factors dominate overall electricity demand levels, whereas temperature mainly governs day-to-day and seasonal fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Temperature Explains — and What It Does Not\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, the results suggest a clear division in the role of temperature. Temperature is a key determinant of short-run electricity demand, particularly through its influence on heating needs during colder periods. This relationship is robust across specifications and remains stable when controlling for regional heterogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, temperature does not explain why some regions systematically consume more electricity than others. Long-run differences in electricity demand are largely driven by structural and socio-economic factors rather than climate alone. This distinction is crucial for interpreting the results and for understanding the scope of temperature-based explanations of electricity consumption."

    "## 8. Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "While the analysis provides clear evidence of a strong relationship between temperature and electricity consumption, several limitations should be acknowledged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Omitted Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The regression models focus primarily on temperature and regional fixed effects. Other factors that may influence electricity consumption — such as electricity prices, income levels, industrial activity, or building characteristics — are not explicitly included. As a result, the estimated relationships may partly capture the influence of omitted variables correlated with temperature or regional characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Causality\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimated coefficients should be interpreted as statistical associations rather than causal effects. Temperature is not randomly assigned, and unobserved factors may simultaneously affect temperature and electricity demand. Although the consistency between descriptive patterns and regression results strengthens the interpretation, the analysis does not identify a causal effect in a strict econometric sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "Both electricity consumption and weather variables are aggregated at the daily regional level. This aggregation may mask intra-day variation and local heterogeneity within regions. In addition, the use of representative weather points may not fully capture micro-climatic differences within large regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations, the analysis remains informative for understanding broad patterns in electricity consumption and the role of temperature at the regional and daily levels.\n"

    "## 9. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigated how daily temperature is related to electricity consumption across French regions over the period 2020–2024. The analysis shows a clear and robust negative relationship between temperature and electricity demand: colder days are systematically associated with higher electricity consumption, reflecting heating needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond this short-run effect, the study highlights strong and persistent regional heterogeneity in electricity consumption. Descriptive statistics and fixed-effects regressions show that temperature explains day-to-day and seasonal fluctuations within regions, but it does not account for large differences in average consumption levels across regions. In particular, Île-de-France consistently exhibits higher electricity demand even after controlling for temperature, indicating that structural factors such as population density and economic activity play a dominant role.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several extensions could further enrich the analysis. Incorporating additional climatic variables (such as heating degree days or extreme temperature indicators), socio-economic controls, or time fixed effects could improve the explanatory power of the model. Exploring non-linear temperature effects or distinguishing between residential and industrial consumption would also provide a more detailed understanding of electricity demand dynamics.\n"
