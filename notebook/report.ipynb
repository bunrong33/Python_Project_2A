    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption is a central issue for modern economies, as it reflects household behavior and economic activity while posing major challenges for energy planning and grid stability. In a context of climate change and increasing weather variability, understanding the determinants of electricity demand is particularly important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these determinants, temperature plays a key role. In countries where heating relies partly on electricity, colder temperatures are typically associated with higher electricity demand, while warmer periods correspond to lower consumption. These effects are often seasonal and may differ across regions depending on climate, population density, and economic structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigates the relationship between **daily temperature and electricity consumption across French regions** over the period **2020–2024**. France provides a relevant case study due to its diverse regional climates, its relatively high share of electric heating, and the availability of detailed open data on both electricity consumption and weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main research question is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **To what extent does daily temperature influence electricity consumption across regions in France?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this question, the analysis proceeds in three steps. First, descriptive statistics are used to document regional and seasonal patterns. Second, the relationship between temperature and electricity consumption is explored using correlations and time-series visualizations. These results motivate a more formal econometric analysis presented later in the report."

    "## 2. Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "This study relies on two main sources of open data, both available at a daily frequency and covering the period from **January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2024**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Electricity Consumption Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption data are obtained from the French electricity transmission system operator (RTE). The dataset provides **daily electricity consumption aggregated at the regional level** for metropolitan France, measured in megawatt-hours (MWh).\n",
    "\n",
    "These data allow for the analysis of temporal dynamics and regional heterogeneity in electricity demand across France.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Weather Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather data are retrieved from the **NASA POWER API**, which provides standardized meteorological variables derived from satellite observations and reanalysis products. The main variable used in this study is the **daily mean temperature at 2 meters (T2M)**, expressed in degrees Celsius.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API allows reproducible access to historical weather data at specific geographic coordinates, making it possible to construct consistent regional temperature indicators."

    "## 3. Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption and weather data originate from different sources and therefore require preprocessing before joint analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption data obtained from RTE are aggregated at the **daily regional level**. This aggregation aligns the data with the daily frequency of weather observations and smooths short-term intra-day fluctuations, allowing the analysis to focus on demand variations that are plausibly related to temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather data are constructed using **multiple representative geographic points within each region**. For each region, daily mean temperature (T2M) is computed as the average across these points, capturing regional climatic conditions while reducing sensitivity to any single location.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center> <img src=\"../figure/weather_map.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/> </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 1** shows that weather observations are spatially distributed within each region rather than concentrated at a single location. This spatial coverage supports the construction of regional temperature series that are representative of overall regional climatic conditions and less sensitive to local extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "After harmonizing date formats and regional identifiers, electricity consumption and weather data are merged using **region and date** as common keys. Basic validation checks confirm the consistency of the merged dataset and the absence of systematic missing values.\n"

    "## 4. Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "This section presents descriptive statistics for electricity consumption and temperature in order to characterize overall patterns, regional heterogeneity, and seasonal variation prior to formal analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Regional Differences in Electricity Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "Average electricity consumption differs substantially across regions, with large differences in baseline demand across France.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/avg_ele_consumption_region.png\" alt=\"Average electricity consumption by region\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 2.** Average daily electricity consumption by region.\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe strong regional heterogeneity in electricity consumption. Île-de-France stands out as a clear outlier with the highest average demand, indicating that baseline consumption levels differ substantially across regions and cannot be explained by temperature alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Seasonal Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption and temperature exhibit clear and opposite seasonal patterns over the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/seasonal_pattern.png\" alt=\"National electricity consumption and temperature over time\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 3.** National average daily electricity consumption and temperature over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe a strong inverse seasonal relationship between the two variables: periods of low temperature coincide with peaks in electricity demand. This pattern is consistent with increased heating needs during colder months and suggests that temperature plays an important role in driving seasonal variations in electricity consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Year-by-Year Regional Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the stability of regional patterns over time, yearly averages of electricity consumption and temperature are computed for each region.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/yearly_temperature_by_region.png\" alt=\"Average yearly temperature by region\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",

    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/yearly_consumption_by_region.png\" alt=\"Average yearly electricity consumption by region\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 4.** Average yearly temperature and electricity consumption by region.\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe that both temperature and electricity consumption patterns are stable across regions over time. While southern regions consistently exhibit higher average temperatures and northern regions remain colder, Île-de-France does not rank among the coldest regions. Despite this, it consistently displays the highest electricity consumption across all years. This contrast indicates that high electricity demand in Île-de-France is largely driven by structural factors rather than climatic conditions, while temperature mainly explains short-run fluctuations within regions.\n"

    "## 5. Relationship Between Temperature and Electricity Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "This section examines how daily temperature variations are associated with electricity consumption across French regions. The objective is to assess whether temperature fluctuations are systematically linked to changes in electricity demand within regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Correlation Evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson correlations between daily mean temperature (T2M) and electricity consumption are computed separately for each region over the period 2020–2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe a strong negative correlation in all regions, indicating that colder days are associated with higher electricity consumption. This pattern is consistent with heating needs and confirms the strong seasonal relationship documented earlier. The magnitude of the correlation varies across regions, with colder regions generally exhibiting stronger negative correlations than warmer regions such as PACA, suggesting heterogeneity in temperature sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Within-Region Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "To focus on short-run variation, electricity consumption is examined relative to its regional average, and temperature is expressed as deviations from the regional mean. Periods of below-average temperature within a region systematically coincide with above-average electricity consumption, particularly during winter months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Île-de-France is not among the coldest regions on average, its electricity consumption responds to temperature deviations in a manner similar to other regions. This highlights the distinction between baseline consumption levels, which differ across regions, and short-run temperature sensitivity, which appears common across regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the evidence points to a strong and systematic relationship between temperature and electricity consumption, motivating the regression analysis in the next section.\n"
