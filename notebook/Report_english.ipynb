    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption is a central issue for modern economies, as it reflects household behavior and economic activity while posing major challenges for energy planning and grid stability. In a context of climate change and increasing weather variability, understanding the determinants of electricity demand has become particularly important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these determinants, temperature plays a key role. In countries where heating relies partly on electricity, colder temperatures are typically associated with higher electricity demand, while warmer periods correspond to lower consumption. These effects are often seasonal and may differ across regions depending on climatic conditions, population density, and economic structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project examines the relationship between **daily temperature and electricity consumption across French regions** over the period **2020–2024**. France provides a relevant case study due to its diverse regional climates, its relatively high share of electric heating (66% according to EDF), and the availability of detailed open data on both electricity consumption and weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main research question is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **To what extent does daily temperature influence electricity consumption across regions in France?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this question, the analysis proceeds in three steps. First, descriptive statistics are used to document regional heterogeneity, variability, and seasonal patterns in electricity consumption and temperature. Second, the relationship between temperature and electricity consumption is explored using correlations and visual inspection. Finally, these descriptive findings motivate a more formal econometric analysis to quantify the association between temperature and electricity demand while accounting for persistent regional differences."

    "## 2. Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "This study relies on two main sources of open data, both available at a daily frequency and covering the period from **January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2024**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Electricity Consumption Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption data are obtained from the French electricity transmission system operator (RTE). The dataset provides **daily electricity consumption aggregated at the regional level** for metropolitan France, measured in megawatt-hours (MWh).\n",
    "\n",
    "These data allow for the analysis of temporal dynamics and regional heterogeneity in electricity demand across France.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weather Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather data are retrieved from the **NASA POWER API**, which provides standardized meteorological variables derived from satellite observations and reanalysis products. The main variable used in this study is the **daily mean temperature at 2 meters (T2M)**, expressed in degrees Celsius.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API allows reproducible access to historical weather data at specific geographic coordinates, making it possible to construct consistent regional temperature indicators."

    "## 3. Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption and weather data originate from different sources and therefore require preprocessing before joint analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption data obtained from RTE are aggregated at the **daily regional level**. This aggregation aligns the data with the daily frequency of weather observations and smooths short-term intra-day fluctuations, allowing the analysis to focus on demand variations that are plausibly related to temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather data are constructed using **multiple representative geographic points within each region**. For each region, daily mean temperature (T2M) is computed as the average across these points, capturing regional climatic conditions while reducing sensitivity to any single location.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center> <img src=\"../figure/weather_map.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/> </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that weather observations are spatially distributed within each region rather than concentrated at a single location. This spatial coverage supports the construction of regional temperature series that are representative of overall regional climatic conditions and less sensitive to local extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "After harmonizing date formats and regional identifiers, electricity consumption and weather data are merged using **region and date** as common keys. Basic validation checks confirm the consistency of the merged dataset and the absence of systematic missing values."

    "## 4. Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "This section presents descriptive statistics for electricity consumption and temperature across French regions. The goal is to document regional heterogeneity, variability, and seasonal patterns in the data prior to correlation and regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regional Differences in Electricity Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "Average daily electricity consumption differs markedly across regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center> <img src=\"../figure/avg_ele_consumption_region.png\" alt=\"Average electricity consumption by region\" style=\"width: 650px;\"/> </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure shows substantial differences in mean electricity consumption levels. Île-de-France records the highest average consumption, while several regions such as Centre-Val de Loire, Bourgogne–Franche-Comté, and Bretagne exhibit considerably lower averages. These differences indicate pronounced heterogeneity in baseline electricity demand across regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distribution and Variability of Electricity Consumption and Temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond differences in average levels, electricity consumption also varies markedly within regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/consummation_distribution.png\" alt=\"Electricity consumption distribution\" style=\"width: 650px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The distributions of daily electricity consumption are wide in all regions, indicating substantial day-to-day variation. Regions with higher average consumption tend to exhibit broader distributions, but considerable overlap exists across regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dispersion suggests that average consumption alone does not fully describe regional electricity demand patterns and that short-run fluctuations are an important feature of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature distributions differ across regions, though less markedly than electricity consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/temperature_distribution.png\" alt=\"Electricity consumption distribution\" style=\"width: 650px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Southern regions generally exhibit higher median temperatures, while northern and eastern regions tend to be cooler. However, temperature distributions overlap substantially across regions, and differences in central tendency are moderate relative to the large differences observed in electricity consumption levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "This comparison highlights that regional temperature differences are present but limited in magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seasonal Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity consumption and temperature exhibit clear and opposite seasonal patterns over the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/seasonal_pattern.png\" alt=\"National electricity consumption and temperature over time\" style=\"width: 650px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that electricity consumption peaks during colder periods and declines during warmer months, while temperature follows the opposite cycle. This inverse seasonal co-movement is consistent with increased heating-related electricity demand during winter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Year-by-Year Regional Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the stability of regional patterns over time, yearly averages of electricity consumption and temperature are computed for each region.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/yearly_temperature_by_region.png\" alt=\"Average yearly temperature by region\" style=\"width: 650px;\"/>\n",

    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/yearly_consumption_by_region.png\" alt=\"Average yearly electricity consumption by region\" style=\"width: 650px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Yearly averages of electricity consumption and temperature show that regional patterns are stable over time. Regions with higher average consumption remain consistently higher across years, and relative temperature differences across regions change little from year to year. In particular, Île-de-France consistently exhibits the highest electricity consumption despite not being among the coldest regions. This indicates that while temperature explains short-run and seasonal fluctuations within regions, persistent differences in consumption levels across regions are driven by time-invariant factors rather than annual temperature variation."

    "## 5. Relationship Between Temperature and Electricity Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "This section examines the relationship between daily temperature and electricity consumption prior to the regression analysis. The objective is to assess whether temperature is systematically associated with electricity demand and to characterize the nature of this relationship using correlations and visual inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first quantitative summary, we compute the correlation between daily mean temperature (T2M) and electricity consumption separately for each region.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/correlation.png\" alt=\"Electricity consumption vs temperature\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe a **strong negative correlation** between temperature and electricity consumption in all regions. This indicates that electricity demand tends to increase on colder days and decrease as temperatures rise, consistent with heating-related demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude of the correlation varies across regions, reflecting differences in climatic conditions, heating needs, and baseline consumption levels. However, correlations alone do not distinguish between **within-region variation over time** and **cross-region differences in consumption levels**. This limitation motivates further visual inspection and, subsequently, a regression-based analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperature–Consumption Scatter Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The scatter plot below illustrates the relationship between daily temperature and electricity consumption across all observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/ele_vs_consommation.png\" alt=\"Electricity consumption vs temperature\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe a clear negative association between temperature and electricity consumption, with higher demand concentrated at lower temperatures. This pattern is consistent with increased electricity use for heating during colder periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, the wide dispersion of observations for a given temperature level highlights substantial heterogeneity in electricity consumption that cannot be explained by temperature alone. This dispersion reflects persistent regional differences in baseline demand, as well as other unobserved factors affecting electricity use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Winter–Summer Contrast in Electricity Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "To further summarize seasonal differences, we compute average electricity consumption separately for winter and summer in each region. The winter-to-summer ratio provides a normalized measure of seasonal intensity that allows meaningful comparison across regions with different consumption levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center> <img src=\"../figure/summer_winter_table.png\" alt=\"Winter and summer electricity consumption by region\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/> </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Winter electricity consumption exceeds summer consumption in all regions, confirming the presence of a strong and systematic seasonal effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude of this seasonal gap varies substantially across regions. Winter-to-summer consumption ratios range from about 1.3 in southern regions such as PACA to more than 1.6 in Île-de-France, indicating significant heterogeneity in seasonal sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, Île-de-France exhibits one of the largest winter–summer differences despite not being among the coldest regions. This suggests that temperature mainly explains short-run seasonal fluctuations within regions, while persistent differences in electricity demand levels are driven by structural factors rather than climate alone."

    "## 6. Regression Analysis: Temperature and Electricity Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "This section quantifies the relationship between daily temperature and electricity consumption using linear regression models. The objective is to measure how electricity demand responds to temperature variations while accounting for persistent regional differences in consumption levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "All models are estimated using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). Heteroskedasticity-robust (HC1) standard errors are reported to account for potential heteroskedasticity in daily electricity consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pooled OLS Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "We first estimate a pooled OLS regression that relates electricity consumption to daily mean temperature across all regions and dates:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Consommation}_{it} = \\alpha + \\beta \\,\\text{T2M}_{it} + \\varepsilon_{it}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\text{Consommation}_{it}$ denotes daily electricity consumption in region $i$ on day $t$,\n",
    "$\\text{T2M}_{it}$ is the daily mean temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "This specification captures the average association between temperature and electricity consumption, ignoring regional heterogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/pool_OLS.png\" alt=\"Average electricity consumption by region\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimated temperature coefficient is negative and statistically significant. A one-degree Celsius increase in daily mean temperature is associated with a reduction of approximately 5,160 MWh in electricity consumption. This result is consistent with higher electricity demand during colder days due to heating needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the model explains only a limited share of the overall variation in electricity consumption, with $R^2$ of about 0.13. This indicates that temperature alone cannot account for large differences in consumption across regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Region Fixed Effects Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To control for persistent regional differences, we estimate a model including region fixed effects:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Consommation}_{it} = \\alpha + \\beta\\,\\text{T2M}_{it} + \\gamma_i + \\varepsilon_{it}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\gamma_i$ captures time-invariant regional characteristics such as population size, economic activity, and housing stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/fixed_OLS.png\" alt=\"Average electricity consumption by region\" style=\"width: 650px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once regional fixed effects are included, the estimated temperature coefficient remains negative, statistically significant, and similar in magnitude (approximately −5,070 MWh per °C). This suggests that the temperature–consumption relationship reflects within-region variation over time rather than cross-region differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The explanatory power of the model increases substantially, with an $R^2$ of about 0.90, indicating that regional heterogeneity accounts for most of the variation in electricity consumption. Temperature mainly explains short-run fluctuations within regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimated fixed effects confirm that Île-de-France has systematically higher electricity consumption than other regions, even after controlling for temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison of Model Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../figure/compare.png\" alt=\"Average electricity consumption by region\" style=\"width: 450px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the two specifications shows that the estimated temperature effect is stable across models, while controlling for regional fixed effects dramatically improves model fit. This highlights the dominant role of structural regional factors in determining consumption levels, with temperature acting as a key driver of short-term variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results should be interpreted as statistical associations rather than causal effects. Nevertheless, they are consistent with the descriptive analysis and provide strong evidence that temperature plays an important role in shaping daily electricity consumption patterns in France.\n"

    "## 7. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Three results stand out.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, temperature is strongly and consistently associated with electricity consumption: colder days coincide with higher demand in every region. The sign and magnitude are stable across the descriptive patterns and the regression estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, regional heterogeneity dominates the level of consumption. Even after accounting for temperature, regions differ substantially in baseline demand, which is consistent with structural differences that are persistent over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, Île-de-France is a key example of this distinction. It is not among the coldest regions, yet it remains the highest-consumption region across years and seasons. This supports the interpretation that temperature mainly drives short-run variation, while the level of consumption reflects structural factors that are not captured by weather alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "This study documents robust statistical associations, but several limitations matter for interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-causality:** the regression coefficients should be interpreted as conditional associations rather than causal effects. Temperature is not randomly assigned and consumption may respond to other co-moving factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Omitted variables:** the models focus on temperature and region fixed effects. Other drivers of demand (economic activity, demographic structure, building characteristics, energy efficiency, pricing policies) are not included.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aggregation choices:** consumption is measured at the daily regional level and weather is represented by selected regional points. This may smooth intra-day dynamics and local micro-climates, especially within large regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limits, the results provide a coherent and internally consistent picture of how daily temperature relates to regional electricity consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project studied the relationship between daily mean temperature and electricity consumption across 12 metropolitan French regions from 2020 to 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "We find a clear and robust negative relationship: electricity demand increases on colder days. This is visible in correlations and scatter patterns and is confirmed by OLS regressions. When region fixed effects are included, the temperature effect remains similar in magnitude, which supports an interpretation based on within-region variation over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, most differences in electricity consumption levels are explained by persistent regional heterogeneity. Île-de-France remains a high-demand outlier even after controlling for temperature, highlighting the importance of structural factors beyond climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural extension (beyond the scope of this report) would be to explore non-linear temperature effects or add additional weather indicators to better capture heating and cooling intensity.\n"
